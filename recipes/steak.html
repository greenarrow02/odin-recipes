		<li>2tps of any high smoke point oil</li>
        <li>kosher salt</li>

    <h4>instructions</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Season steak generously with kosher salt and pepper and let sit at room temperature 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Heat a dry large skillet, preferably cast iron, over medium-high, then add oil. As soon as oil is smoking, cook steak, turning every 2 minutes or so, until a deep brown crust forms and the internal temperature is a few degrees below 120°–125° for medium-rare(If you do not like steak medium rare grow up)</li>
        <li>Add butter, rosemary, and garlic to skillet, tilt pan toward you so that butter pools on one side, and use a large spoon to continually baste steak with butter. Continue until butter is no longer bubbling and it smells nutty and is beginning to brown, about 1 minute. Transfer meat to a cutting board and let rest 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Cut meat from bone and slice against the grain 1" thick. Spoon some infused brown butter over steak and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
